# sphinx-to-tr
Transform Sphinx doc (e.g. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/index.html) to [W3C /TR/](http://www.w3.org/TR/).

This was built to TR-ify the WebAssembly spec but may gain a life of its own if
* other W3C groups adopt Sphinx.
* non-W3C groups using Sphinx want to publish TR-like docs.
